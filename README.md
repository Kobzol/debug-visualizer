Devi (debug visualizer)
=======================

Devi is a graphical debugger frontend that visualizes the debugged
program's memory in a form of an object diagram. It can be used for
debugging C/C++ programs with the attached GDB 7.11.

It contains a self-contained communication library that can be adapted
to work with various other debuggers (it can be found in the package
`debugger`).

The application is licensed under GNU GPLv3.
